InSight is an integrated system designed to enhance security and user interaction through the combination of a mobile application and a Raspberry Pi-based facial recognition system. The project encompasses two primary components: a mobile application developed in Android studio with Java and a web-based control system utilizing Python and HTML, hosted on a Raspberry Pi. The mobile application facilitates user management tasks such as registration, login, profile updates, and image handling, leveraging Firebase for backend services. Concurrently, the Raspberry Pi system captures real-time video, processes facial recognition, and provides motor control for viewing different angles of the video stream.

This project aims to create a seamless user experience by enabling users to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles through the mobile app while utilizing the Raspberry Pi system for real-time surveillance and control.
